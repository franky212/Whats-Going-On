This is a React / Redux project incorporating multiple APIs (TicketMaster, Google Maps, Google Geocoding).

This project was made when I was attending V School for Javascript Web Development, and I'm
currently in the process of redesigning / recoding this and working on new, better projects as well.

It was made using the create-react-app CLI, and I've now moved on to making my own front end
development environments with Webpack / other Automation Tools.
